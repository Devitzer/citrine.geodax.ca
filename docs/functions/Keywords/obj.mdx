# obj

The obj keyword is used to declare object variables! Will return an error if the variable is not an object.

## Example:

```txt title="example.ob"
obj x = {
    propertyOne: "This is property one",
    propertyTwo: "This is property two"
}
io.print(x.propertyOne) # output: This is property one
x = "Hello!" # this returns an error
```
