# if

The if keyword is used to check conditions, returns true or false depening on what the condition is.
True means it will run the code and false means it will keep on going in the code unless it finds an "Alternate"
An alternate can be 3 things, nothing, another if statement, or an else statement. If it's nothing it will continue, I'm sure you can figure it out.

## Example:

```txt title="example.ob"
let x = 5
let y = 5

# If takes in a condition, and what to do if the condition is true.

if x == y {
    io.print("Hello, World!")
}

# The output here would be "Hello World!" because x is equal to y.
```
