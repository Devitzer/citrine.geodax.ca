# import

The import keyword is used to import built in libraries, and user made ones.

## Example:

```txt title="example.ob"
import fs
fs.readFile("monkey.txt") # output: whatever is in that readFile
```

## Example with user libraries:

WARNING! Because of the way this works, whether you exported or didn't export a module, if you import it, all variables and functions from the module will be declared.

```txt title="example.ob"
import "./myModule.ob" # int myInt = 5 export { myInt } <<< file contents
io.print(myInt) # result: 5
```
