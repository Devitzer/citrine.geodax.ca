# else

Else is used as an alternate for the [if](./if.mdx) keyword. Basically, if the if statement returns false, it will come to the else statement.

## Example:

```txt title="example.ob"
let x = 5
let y = 6

if x == y {
    io.print("Hello, World!")
} else {
    io.print("Goodbye, World!")
}

# Output: "Goodbye, World!"
# This is the output because 5 is not equal to 6, and else is the alternate.
```
