Hello! This is the first devlog of CitrineScript! I am Devitzer and today I will be covering what I am working on today, **objects.**

## Objects

Today, I am working on Object Literals, which are the curly braces {}
And so you will be able to do something like { foo: "bar" } and even just { foo } like that.

## Maybes

I will probably have time to work on native functions, such as print() and if I rush myself a lot, I will be able to make user defined functions and release CitrineScript! Although, even if CitrineScript is done today, I still have to make a CLI to run it, like node for JS. And set some other things to make it compatible with your devices!

## Conclusion

So that is all I have today, if I do end up working on something other than objects, I will update you. Bye!
