As of making this article, CitrineScript isn't actually out yet. But I would still like to introduce you to my programming language!

## Why did I take up such a big project?

This is a good question, considering my last few have been simple NPM packages, and now I am suddenly taking up a whole programming language with a lexer, parser and compiler?

Well, I decided that I needed to scale up my projects, with my basic coding knowledge of JavaScript and barely any TypeScript, I decided that I need to move on to something big, as I like to believe I can learn quick.

So, I made several decisions to try several new things!

## 1. TypeScript and ESM

I decided to use **TypeScript and ESM.** If you know me, you know that TypeScript and ESM are the two last thing's I would want to be stuck working on. So that's what I picked to lex, parse, and compile my language!

And because I decided to use TypeScript and ESM, I also decided that the best runtime that supports this is:

## 2. Deno

**Deno.** If you know anything about developing with TypeScript and ESM *specifically,* is that Deno is the best runtime for both of these. 
Deno is a fast and secure runtime and I am actually quite starting to enjoy it although will probably only use it for TypeScript projects.

If you would like to know more about Deno, check it out [here](https://deno.land).

PS: I still love node forever, just because of it's simplicity.

## Conclusion

This is all I have for now. Soon, there will be documentation for the two functions I plan to come out with, impressive right!?

## 1. Some notes

I plan to constantly implement new updates for CitrineScript, but as an independent developer which I like it that way, you cannot expect fast updates.

If you would like to know the specific functions I plan to implement first, well there are several. While there are two "functions" there are also some other cool features.

Here is a small snippet of every single feature that CitrineScript will release with.

```txt title="example.ob"
// IF YOU SEE COMMENTS LIKE THIS, KNOW THAT THEY WILL NOT EXIST IN INITIAL RELEASE

let x = 5
let x; // Semicolons only needed on expressions like this.
x = 5 // Let's keep this at 5 for now.

// You can also set constant/static variables

static y = 10
static y; // This should give an error. Because it is static.

declare print_coordinates(x, y) {
    io.print("X Coord: ", x, " Y Coord: ", y)
}

print_coordinates(x, y) // Result: X Coord: 5 Y Coord: 10
```

A long enough example that shows release features. Or at least the 0.x chain.

That is all I have, I will update you on the development, goodbye!
